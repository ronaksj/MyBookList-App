# MyBookList-App
- I made this app to save the details of your books. JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS have all been utilised.
- The user will enter the book's title, author, a special number called an ISBN, and a date.
- A new table and rows will be created. The information will then be kept in localStorage.
- The User can also Delete/Remove bookdata from storage.
- Messages will be shown as per user actions like Add/remove.
- This bookList app is inspired by To-do-list.
